DATA ANALYST PROJECTS
------------------------------
1. MY First Project in QlikSense is 'MYNTRA SALES ANALYSIS DASHBOARD'
   In this Dashboard , I have use DAR(Data Analysis Report) Concept to show insights of data.
   So Lets Understand the Concept of Data Analysis Report (DAR) in Qliksense :-

   In Qlik Sense, creating a Data Analysis Report (DAR) involves using the various features and functionalities available in the platform to analyze and visualize data, 
   and then presenting the insights in a comprehensive report format.
   
  Here's a general guide on how to create a DAR in Qlik Sense:
   1. Data Loading and Modeling:
      
-- Import your data into Qlik Sense.

-- Use the data modeling capabilities to create associations between different data tables.

-- Transform and clean your data as necessary using Qlik's scripting language (QlikScript) or by using the data manager.

 2. Data Visualization:

-- Create visualizations using Qlik Sense's drag-and-drop interface.

-- Choose appropriate chart types such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, etc., based on your data    and analysis requirements.

-- Utilize features like drill-down, selections, and set analysis to interactively explore data and gain    insights.


3. Dashboard Creation:

-- Assemble your visualizations into a dashboard layout.

-- Arrange the visualizations logically to tell a coherent story or to address specific analytical    questions.

-- Use containers, sheets, and tabs to organize your dashboard if needed.


4. Advanced Analysis:

-- Apply advanced analytics functions such as forecasting, trend analysis, clustering, etc., 
   using Qlik Sense's built-in functions or extensions.

-- Utilize set analysis and advanced expressions for complex calculations and comparisons.



5. Interactivity and Exploration:

-- Ensure that the dashboard is interactive, allowing users to make selections and see how the data    changes dynamically.

-- Use filters, bookmarks, and other features to enhance the user experience and facilitate exploration.




6. Report Generation:

-- Export the dashboard or individual visualizations as images or PDFs for static reporting purposes.

-- Alternatively, use Qlik NPrinting, an extension of Qlik Sense, 
   to create pixel-perfect reports with dynamic data, charts, and tables.


7. Sharing and Collaboration:

-- Publish the DAR to Qlik Sense Enterprise server or Qlik Cloud for sharing with other users.

-- Enable collaborative features to allow users to comment on and discuss insights within the dashboard.


8. Scheduled Refresh and Distribution:

-- Set up scheduled data refreshes to ensure that your DAR always reflects the latest data.

-- Configure distribution tasks to automatically send reports to stakeholders via email or other channels.
